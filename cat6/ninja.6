          The host and port _i_m_a_z_e_s_r_v(6) is using.

     -i   Use an inverse  strategy:  ninja  runs  away  from  the
          nearest player (backwards).

          Message that is sent to other  players  when  they  are
          killed.

     -s _s_h_o_t-_p_e_r_c_e_n_t_a_g_e
          Probability that _n_i_n_j_a will shoot when no shot  of  his
          is there. Default is 100.

     -t _c_o_l_o_r-_i_n_d_e_x
          Run towards player with color _c_o_l_o_r-_i_n_d_e_x  as  reported
          by _i_m_a_z_e_s_t_a_t(6).
